# Pokemon-Battle

# This is a basic Pokemon game. Each player has 3 Pokemon, damage calculations are based on the actual formula used in the Pokemon RPG game.
# To play the game, simply run the file "battle.py" on your IDE.

# I coded this game with about 9 months of experience in coding in Python.
